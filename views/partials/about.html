      No, not at all! This was just made for fun by an independent developer.

    <b class="db f3 mb1">What is this?</b>
    <span class="f5 db lh-copy measure">
      It's a tool that uses the gmail API to tally up the cost of your Uber Receipts, and tells you how much you've spent.

      Why do you need access to my emails? Why not use the Uber API?
    </b>
    <span class="f5 db lh-copy measure">
      The Uber API restricts access to receipt information.  Only apps that handle making Uber orders are given access to receipts.

      Does this work if I deleted my emails from Uber?

      Not in the US?
    </b>
    <span class="f5 db lh-copy measure">
      For this initial release, this app is specifically looking for emails from uber.us@uber.com and US currency.  It might work if you're outside the US, but it might not.
      I plan on making this work globally soon.
